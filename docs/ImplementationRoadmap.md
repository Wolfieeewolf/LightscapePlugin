# Lightscape Effect System - Implementation Roadmap

*Project Repository: [https://github.com/Wolfieeewolf/LightscapePlugin](https://github.com/Wolfieeewolf/LightscapePlugin)*

This document outlines the step-by-step implementation plan for enhancing the Lightscape plugin with an improved effect system based on OpenRGBEffectsPlugin concepts. Use this as a checklist to track progress through each stage of development.

## Overview of Stages

1. Core Architecture Enhancements
2. UI Framework Updates
3. Effect Implementation
4. Setup and Testing System

## Stage 1: Core Architecture Enhancements

**Goal:** Extend the base architecture to support both spatial and non-spatial effects

### Tasks

| Task | Status | Notes |
|------|--------|-------|
| Enhance `BaseEffect` class with `StepEffect` method | Completed | Added OpenRGBEffectsPlugin-style interface with automatic handling of spatial and non-spatial zones |
| Create `SpatialControllerZone` adapter | Completed | Implemented adapter between OpenRGB devices and spatial grid |
| Update `EffectManager` to handle both types of zones | Completed | Added support for both spatial and traditional interfaces with optional threading |
| Enhance `EffectRegistry` with category support | Completed | Added category parameter to effect registration |

### Deliverables

- [x] Updated base classes that support both interfaces
- [x] Working adapter between controller zones and grid positions
- [x] Enhanced effect manager with threading support
- [x] Improved effect registration system

## Stage 2: UI Framework Updates

**Goal:** Create an improved UI that handles multiple effects and device assignment

### Tasks

| Task | Status | Notes |
|------|--------|-------|
| Create tabbed interface for managing multiple effects | Not Started | Support multiple active effects |
| Implement effect tab headers with controls | Not Started | Start/stop buttons, etc. |
| Update device list for spatial positioning | Not Started | Controls for positioning devices |
| Enhance grid visualization with better controls | Not Started | Reference point selection, etc. |
| Implement profile saving and loading | Not Started | Save and restore configurations |

### Deliverables

- [ ] Tabbed effect interface
- [ ] Enhanced device list with positioning controls
- [ ] Improved grid visualization
- [ ] Profile saving and loading system

## Stage 3: Effect Implementation

**Goal:** Create sample effects that demonstrate the combined system

### Tasks

| Task | Status | Notes |
|------|--------|-------|
| Implement SpatialRainbow effect template | Not Started | Basic effect showcasing position-based coloring |
| Create SpatialWave effect | Not Started | Wave propagation through 3D space |
| Add PulseEffect with reference point | Not Started | Pulsing effect from reference point |
| Implement AudioResponsive spatial effect | Not Started | Audio visualization in 3D space |
| Create effect category organization | Not Started | Organize effects into categories |

### Deliverables

- [ ] At least 4 working effects showcasing different aspects of the system
- [ ] Examples of how to leverage both interfaces
- [ ] Effects categorized by type
- [ ] Documentation for each effect

## Stage 4: Setup and Testing System

**Goal:** Make the system easy to configure and verify

### Tasks

| Task | Status | Notes |
|------|--------|-------|
| Create setup wizard for initial configuration | Not Started | Guide for setting up the grid and devices |
| Implement test patterns for verification | Not Started | Sequential tests, axis tests, etc. |
| Add diagnostic tools | Not Started | Performance monitoring, etc. |
| Create final documentation | Not Started | Complete user and developer guides |

### Deliverables

- [ ] Setup wizard for guided configuration
- [ ] Test patterns for device verification
- [ ] Performance monitoring tools
- [ ] Complete documentation for users and developers

## Development Workflow

For each component, we'll follow these steps:

1. **Design:** Review and finalize specific implementation details
2. **Implementation:** Write the code for the component
3. **Testing:** Verify functionality with test cases
4. **Documentation:** Update relevant documentation
5. **Integration:** Ensure the component works with the rest of the system

## Progress Tracking

We'll update this document as we progress through each task:

- **Not Started**: Task has been identified but work hasn't begun
- **In Progress**: Work on the task has started but isn't complete
- **Completed**: Task is finished and tested

## Current Focus

Stage 1 (Core Architecture Enhancements) has been completed. Current focus is on Stage 2 with UI Framework Updates to support multiple effects and improved device assignment.

## Next Steps

After completing a stage, we'll review progress and adjust the plan as needed based on what we've learned during implementation.
