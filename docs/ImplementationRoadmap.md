# Lightscape Effect System - Implementation Roadmap

*Project Repository: [https://github.com/Wolfieeewolf/LightscapePlugin](https://github.com/Wolfieeewolf/LightscapePlugin)*

This document outlines the step-by-step implementation plan for enhancing the Lightscape plugin with an improved effect system based on OpenRGBEffectsPlugin concepts. Use this as a checklist to track progress through each stage of development.

## Overview of Stages

1. Core Architecture Enhancements
2. UI Framework Updates
3. Effect Implementation
4. Setup and Testing System

## Stage 1: Core Architecture Enhancements

**Goal:** Extend the base architecture to support both spatial and non-spatial effects

### Tasks

| Task | Status | Notes |
|------|--------|-------|
| Enhance `BaseEffect` class with `StepEffect` method | Completed | Added OpenRGBEffectsPlugin-style interface with automatic handling of spatial and non-spatial zones |
| Create `SpatialControllerZone` adapter | Completed | Implemented adapter between OpenRGB devices and spatial grid |
| Update `EffectManager` to handle both types of zones | Completed | Added support for both spatial and traditional interfaces with optional threading |
| Enhance `EffectRegistry` with category support | Completed | Added category parameter to effect registration |

### Deliverables

- [x] Updated base classes that support both interfaces
- [x] Working adapter between controller zones and grid positions
- [x] Enhanced effect manager with threading support
- [x] Improved effect registration system

## Stage 2: UI Framework Updates

**Goal:** Create an improved UI that handles multiple effects and device assignment

### Tasks

| Task | Status | Notes |
|------|--------|-------|
| Create tabbed interface for managing multiple effects | Completed | Added EffectTabWidget with custom tab headers |
| Implement effect tab headers with controls | Completed | Implemented start/stop, close, and rename functionality |
| Update device list for simplicity | Completed | Added DeviceListWidget for easy device selection |
| Enhance grid visualization with interactive 3D preview | Completed | Implemented PreviewRenderer with 3D visualization |
| Update UI layout for intuitive control placement | Completed | Moved buttons to their respective panels for better usability |
| Implement profile saving and loading | Completed | Added JSON-based effect profiles |

### Deliverables

- [x] Tabbed effect interface
- [x] Enhanced device list with selection controls
- [x] Improved grid visualization
- [x] Profile saving and loading system

## Stage 3: Effect Implementation

**Goal:** Create sample effects that demonstrate the combined system

### Tasks

| Task | Status | Notes |
|------|--------|-------|
| Implement SpatialRainbow effect template | Not Started | Basic effect showcasing position-based coloring |
| Create SpatialWave effect | Not Started | Wave propagation through 3D space |
| Add PulseEffect with reference point | Not Started | Pulsing effect from reference point |
| Implement AudioResponsive spatial effect | Not Started | Audio visualization in 3D space |
| Create effect category organization | Not Started | Organize effects into categories |

### Deliverables

- [ ] At least 4 working effects showcasing different aspects of the system
- [ ] Examples of how to leverage both interfaces
- [ ] Effects categorized by type
- [ ] Documentation for each effect

## Stage 4: Setup and Testing System

**Goal:** Make the system easy to configure and verify

### Tasks

| Task | Status | Notes |
|------|--------|-------|
| Create setup wizard for initial configuration | Not Started | Guide for setting up the grid and devices |
| Implement test patterns for verification | Not Started | Sequential tests, axis tests, etc. |
| Add diagnostic tools | Not Started | Performance monitoring, etc. |
| Create final documentation | Not Started | Complete user and developer guides |

### Deliverables

- [ ] Setup wizard for guided configuration
- [ ] Test patterns for device verification
- [ ] Performance monitoring tools
- [ ] Complete documentation for users and developers

## Development Workflow

For each component, we'll follow these steps:

1. **Design:** Review and finalize specific implementation details
2. **Implementation:** Write the code for the component
3. **Testing:** Verify functionality with test cases
4. **Documentation:** Update relevant documentation
5. **Integration:** Ensure the component works with the rest of the system

## Progress Tracking

We'll update this document as we progress through each task:

- **Not Started**: Task has been identified but work hasn't begun
- **In Progress**: Work on the task has started but isn't complete
- **Completed**: Task is finished and tested

## Current Focus

Stage 2 (UI Framework Updates) has been completed and undergone a significant enhancement. The following improvements have been made:

1. **Preview System Enhancement:**
   - Modified the preview renderer to show solid 3D cubes instead of wireframes, maintaining a flat aesthetic
   - Improved the visualization of device positions in the grid
   - Enhanced the preview to be visible at all times, showing the grid whether or not an effect is selected

2. **Effect Lifecycle Management:**
   - Revised effect application mechanism to only trigger effects when play button is pressed
   - Added clear visual indicators for when effects are inactive vs. running
   - Improved error handling and user feedback for effect operations
   - Fixed issues with effect start/stop behavior

3. **Vertical Tab Layout:**
   - Rearranged the effect tabs to display vertically for better organization
   - Improved the tab design to provide better visual feedback about effect status

Current focus remains on Stage 3: Effect Implementation to create a set of sample effects that showcase the capabilities of the enhanced framework. Additional attention is being given to fixing the current UI issues to ensure smooth operation before proceeding.

## Next Steps

The next step is to implement the first spatial effect (SpatialRainbow) that will showcase the position-based coloring capabilities of the system. This will be followed by more complex effects that demonstrate different aspects of the spatial framework.
