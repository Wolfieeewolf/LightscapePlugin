# Lightscape Plugin for OpenRGB

Lightscape is a 3D spatial LED control system plugin for OpenRGB that allows you to organize and control your RGB devices in a three-dimensional grid layout with advanced lighting effects.

## Project Background

This project was inspired by the Philips amBX Gaming peripheral system from 2006. The goal is to recreate and modernize the amBX concept using current RGB hardware and the OpenRGB framework. For reference, you can see the original amBX system here: [Philips amBX Gaming Peripherals](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TWC3ruGYif0)

## Development Note

This entire plugin was created using assistance from:
- [Claude AI](https://claude.ai)
- [ChatGPT](https://chat.openai.com)
- [DeepSeek](https://www.deepseek.com/)

As such:
- This is a very early alpha version
- There may be bugs and issues
- Some features might not work as expected
- Error handling might be incomplete

## Features
