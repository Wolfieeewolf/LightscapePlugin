# Lightscape Plugin for OpenRGB

Lightscape is a 3D spatial LED control system plugin for OpenRGB that allows you to organize and control your RGB devices in a three-dimensional grid layout with advanced lighting effects.

## Project Background

This project was inspired by the Philips amBX Gaming peripheral system from 2006. The goal is to recreate and modernize the amBX concept using current RGB hardware and the OpenRGB framework. For reference, you can see the original amBX system here: [Philips amBX Gaming Peripherals](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TWC3ruGYif0)

## Development Note

This entire plugin was created using assistance from:
- [Claude AI](https://claude.ai)


As such:
- This is a very early alpha version
- There may be bugs and issues
- Some features might not work as expected
- Error handling might be incomplete

## Features

## Open Source and Collaboration

Feel free to fork this repository and modify it however you like! This project is meant to be:
- An experiment in AI-assisted development
- A learning resource for others
- A foundation for community improvements
- Open to any and all modifications

If you're interested in the intersection of AI and development, this project serves as a real-world example of what's possible.

## Development Status

This plugin is in very early alpha stage. Expect bugs and incomplete features. Please report any issues or feature requests through GitHub issues, but understand that as this is an AI-assisted project, fixes and updates may take time as we experiment with the best ways to implement changes.
